# 5-Dimensional Chess

A chess game that involves moving pieces into other dimensions and into the future.

## Rules:

All of the standard rules of chess apply. If you don't know how to play chess, you should learn before playing this game. You can learn at [this site](https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess "Chess.com").

### Interdimensional travel

There are two dimensions that chess pieces can occupy. You can consider one of them to be a "mirror dimension" if you like. After moving, each piece will automatically move to the opposite dimension.

Pieces on one dimension can pass through pieces on another, and can only capture pieces on the same dimension.

All moves must be legal on the dimension they are on. This means it is not possible to move a king into check, even if it will immediately jump into another dimension to escape afterwards.

The mirror dimension is based on V. R. Parton's [Alice Chess](http://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/alice.html "Alice: A chess variant").

### Time travel

While moving a piece, it is possible to move it into the future, using the options on the top left.

A piece in the future can be captured only by moving a piece into the same time in the future.

Kings may not time travel. Pawns cannot time travel and be promoted on the same turn.

### Other notes:

Two pieces cannot occupy the same space on the board, even if they are in different dimensions or times.

En passant is possible only if the two pawns involved are in the same dimension. En passant cannot be used to capture two pieces in one turn.
